<h1>Simon's Angular Apps Portfolio</h1>
<p>
  This website is a personal project. I created this to continue practicing and learning more about the Angular framework, as well as integrate some of the open-source UI tools available.

  This site uses the UI framework, <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/">PrimeNG</a>. So far, it's my favorite UI library for Angular. I'm also using Font Awesome icons.
